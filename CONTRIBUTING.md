## Contributing to SafeBot

We are always looking for developers to help improve SafeBot. If you notice any bugs, or want to implement your own features, you can do so by following the guidelines below.

### Code

- If you are implementing or fixing an issue, please comment on the issue so work is not duplicated and can be assigned.
- If you want to implement a new feature, create an issue first describing the issue. This way others can be aware about it and not work on or request the same feature.
- Don't commit unnecessary changes to the codebase, or any code that could be classed as "debugging". This ensures that our commit history remains tidy.
- The commit messages should be prefaced with "feat", "chore", or "bugfix". This ensures consistency and easy to reference commits.
- Please try to follow the code style of the rest of the codebase.

### Pull Requests

- Only implement one feature per pull request, this makes code review more efficient and has a better chance of being merged.
- Expect comments, requested changes or questions on your pull request from the project maintainers.
- Each pull request should come from a new branch in your forked copy of the repository, and branch names should be meaningful to the feature you're introducing or the bug you're fixing.

We will try to review & triage issues as fast as possible, but if you believe we may have missed your issue or pull request, let us know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/safemoon).
